As more and more developer support forums abandon their legacy websites to move onto Stack Overflow, lots of user-generated knowledge is at risk of being left behind.

Recently, more and more developer communities are abandoning their legacy support forums, moving onto Stack Overflow. The motivations are diverse, yet they typically include achieving faster response time and larger visibility through the access to a modern and very successful infrastructure.

we add to the body of evidence of existing research on best answer prediction and show that, from a technical perspective, the content from existing developer forums might be automatically migrated to the Stack Overflow, although most of forums do not allow to mark a question as resolved, a distinctive feature of modern question answering sites. For this purpose, we trained a binary classifier with data from Stack Overflow and then tested it with data scraped from Docusign, a developer forum that has recently completed the move.
